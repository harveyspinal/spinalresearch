The last follow-up date is crucial because it indicates how the patient is and if other follow-up dates need to be applied.",

The PGI-I is a 1-item questionnaire designed to assess the patient's impression of change with values ranging from 1 to 7; higher scores mean a worse outcome. Patient is required to ""Check the one number that best describes how you feel now"" by entering his answer on a 7-point scale scored as: (1) ""very much better,"" (2) ""much better,"" (3) ""a little better,"" (4) ""no change,"" (5) ""a little worse,"" (6) ""much worse,"" or (7) ""very much worse."" For this study, investigators will evaluated as primary outcome measure ""the percentage of patient gave a response to PGI-I equal to or less than 2"".","Qualiveen-Short Form (SF) questionnaire [at the end of screening period named Visit 0, and at Visit 2 (weeks 12-16 from Visit 1, that is the management start-up visit)] — In participants with recorded LUTS, it will be measured the patient reported urinary-related quality of life by means of the Qualiveen-Short Form (SF) questionnaire. It's a specific health related quality of life (HRQOL) with questionnaire for urinary disorders in patients with neurological conditions, such as Multiple Sclerosis.

The Qualiveen-SF is an 8-items questionnaire. Response options are framed as 5-point Likert-type scales with 0 indicating no impact of urinary problems on HRQOL and 4 indicating a high adverse impact of urinary difficulty on HRQOL. Qualiveen domain scores are calculated as an average of the scores on items in that domain and, thus, the range is 0 to 4 with an overall score representing the mean of the 4 domains, which also ranges from 0 to 4. Higher scores mean worse outcome.

For this study investigators will evaluated whether three-months (max 4 months) of urinary disorder stable management may change HRQOL in terms of Qualiveen-SF scores.; Post-void residual volume (PVR) assessment [at visit 0 and Visit 2 (weeks 12-16 from Visit 1, that is the management start-up visit)] — The post-void residual volume (PVR) measured in ml is the urine volume remaining in bladder after a physiological micturition. It will be measured by ultrasound scans and calculated by the radiologist subtracting post-void bladder volume from pre-void bladder volume.

For this study, the investigators will evaluate whether three months (max 4 months) of urinary disorder stable management may change the amount of PVR.

Lower volume values mean better outcome.; Micturitions' frequency and episodes of urgency/incontinence at three days frequency/volume chart [at visit 0 and Visit 2 (weeks 12-16 from Visit 1, that is the management start-up visit)] — In participants with recorded LUTS, it will be measured the number of daily micturitions and episodes of urgency or incontinence signed on a three days frequency/volume chart. Frequency/volume chart is a brief diary where patients are asked to record for three days how many times they urinate and the volume of each micturition; they are also asked to record each episode of urinary urgency and incontinence. Higher numbers mean worse outcome.

As secondary outcome, it will be evaluated whether three months (max 4 months) of urinary disorder stable management may change the numbers of micturitions and numbers of urinary urgency and/or incontinence.","Prevalence of LUTS [at Visit 0 (screening visit)] — Considering all participants underwent screening visit, it will be estimated the prevalence of Low Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS); a new diagnostic screening model consisting of the Urinary Bothersome Questionnaire for Multiple Sclerosis (UBQ-MS), the Actionable Bladder Symptoms Screening Tool (ABSST) questionnaire and the PVR volume is used; LUTS is defined by the presence of at least one diagnostic tool with abnormal finding: UBQ-MS score at least 1, ABSST at least 3, PVR at least 100 ml or more than 30% of pre-void assessed volume.; Demographic, Clinical and instrumental characteristics [at visit 0 (screening visit)] — Evaluating the presence of demographic (age, sex, BMI), clinical (disease duration, phenotype, Expanded Disease Status Scale, spinal lesions and their location, therapy, comorbidities) and instrumental factors (urinalysis with urine culture, radiological imaging, number of urinations and urgency-frequency episodes with frequency / volume chart) predictive of the type of urinary disorders reported.; Patient global impression of Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire, Qualiveen-Short Form questionnaire, Post-void residual volume (PVR) amount, Micturitions' frequency and episodes of urgency/incontinence at three days frequency/volume chart [at visit 0 (screening visit) and visit 2 (weeks 12-16 from Visit 1, that is the management start-up visit)] — Finally, by means of a subgroup analysis, the investigators will evaluate whether enrolled participants managed by neurologists or by urologists show any difference in scores of Patient global impression of Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire, Qualiveen-Short Form questionnaire, Post-void residual volume (PVR) assessment, Micturitions' frequency and episodes of urgency/incontinence at three days frequency/volume chart.

It is composed by four questions that evaluate frequency, severity, and impact of incontinence on QoL and another section evaluating usual urinary loss situations. The minimum and maximum values range between 0-21 points. Higher the score, the greater the severity of the symptoms.

The ICIQ-SF has been chosen as the validation questionnaire.; Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score Questionnaire (NBSS) [6 months] — Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score Questionnaire is a 24 item self-reported questionnaire (0-74 points). The questionnaire includes 4 subgroups; incontinence (0-29 points), storage\&voiding (0-22 points) and consequences (0-23 points). Higher the score, the greater the severity of the symptoms.; Qualiveen [6 months] — The Qualiveen is divided in two major sections-Specific Impact of Urinary Problems on Quality of Life (SIUP) and General Quality of Life (GQoL).

The first part, specific for urinary problems, has a total of 30 questions and is divided in four domains: inconvenience, restrictions, fears, and impact on daily life (9, 8, 8, and 5 questions, respectively).

Each answer has five quantified items on a five category ordinal Likert scale with values ranging from 0 (no impact) to 4 (greatest negative impact). The average for each domain is calculated and used to obtain the final SIUP score (average of all domains, range from 0 to 4, 4 being the greatest negative impact).

The second section, GQoL, has nine questions, also with a five-category ordinal Likert scale. It ranges from Very badly to Very well, with values ranging from -2 to +2, respectively.

Final general QoL value is calculated as the average for the nine questions, also ranging from -2 to +2.; Short Form Qualiveen (SF-Qualiveen) [6 months] — The SF-Qualiveen is a validated short version of the Qualiveen questionnaire and evaluates urinary-specific quality of life. The SF-Qualiveen consists of eight questions and reports on four domains of two questions each: bother with limitations, fears, feelings, and frequency of limitations. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert like scale, where a score of 0 indicates ""no impact"" and 4 ""high impact."" The SF-Qualiveen total score is calculated as the mean of the eight responses and the domain scores are calculated as the mean score of the responses per domain.; The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) [6 months] — The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is one of the most widely used for assessing QOL in patients with urinary incontinence (UI).The KHQ consists of two parts and 32 items. The first part (21 items) contains two single-item questions that address General Health Perception and Incontinence Impact and the following seven multi-item domains: Role, Physical, and Social Limitations, Limitations in Personal Relationship, Emotional Problems, Sleep and Energy Disturbances associated with UI, and Severity Measures for UI. The second part has an 11-item Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) that assesses the presence and severity of urinary symptoms. While the entire SSS is scored from 0 (best) to 30 (worst), the minimum possible score is 0 (best health) and the maximum possible score is 100 (worst health) for all other KHQ domains.",,

Higher the score, the greater the severity of the symptoms.; The King's Health Questionnaire [4 months] — The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is one of the most widely used for assessing QOL in patients with urinary inkontinence.The KHQ consists of two parts and 32 items \[7\]. The first part (21 items) contains two single-item questions that address General Health Perception and Incontinence Impact and the following seven multi-item domains: Role, Physical, and Social Limitations, Limitations in Personal Relationship, Emotional Problems, Sleep and Energy Disturbances associated with UI, and Severity Measures for UI. The second part has an 11-item Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) that assesses the presence and severity of urinary symptoms. While the entire SSS is scored from 0 (best) to 30 (worst), the minimum possible score is 0 (best health) and the maximum possible score is 100 (worst health) for all other KHQ domains.",,

The scale is for parents and scoring is done according to the answers from the parents. The total score is between 0-35 points. As the score obtained from the scale increases, the severity of the patient's symptoms also increases.","Bladder Diary [Change from Baseline at 12th week] — The bladder diary is a simple and non-invasive method of assessing people with lower urinary tract symptoms. The International Children's Continence Society has proposed a chart to assess lower urinary tract dysfunction, showing 48-hour daytime voiding frequency, voiding volume, voiding duration, presence of urgency, type and amount of fluid intake, and degree of urinary incontinence.; Pediatric Incontinence Quality of Life Scale [Change from Baseline at 12th week] — Pediatric Incontinence Quality of Life Scale is the first continence quality of life scale developed in the pediatric population. It is a continence-specific quality of life scale developed for children and adolescents in 2006. The Turkish validity and reliability study was performed in 2011.

In the initial development stages of the PINQ scale, it was developed as 28 questions including 7 dimensions that evaluate children's social relations with their peers, self-esteem, family and home relations, body image, independence, mental health and treatment. In the following studies, these dimensions were grouped into two as Extrinsic (extrinsic) and Intrinsic (intrinsic), and finally the number of questions was arranged as 20. Each question is given a score of 0 (no), 1 (almost never), 2 (sometimes), 3 (often), 4 (always), and a total score (0-80) is calculated. An increase in the total score indicates that the patient's quality of life worsens .; Rome IV Criteria [Change from Baseline at 12th week] — Rome IV criteria allow to detect the presence of constipation in toilet trained or untrained children. Abdominal pain that recurs at least once a week in the last 3 months; If defecation is associated with at least two of the symptoms of a change in the frequency of pooping and a change in the form of poop, constipation is present according to the Rome 4 criteria.; Bristol Stool Scale [Change from Baseline at 12th week] — The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) was developed by Lewis and Heaton at the University of Bristol in 1990 and classifies human faeces into 7 groups. The shape of the stool changes according to the time it stays in the colon. The BSS is a fast and reliable indicator of transit time. There are 7 different poop forms on the Bristol stool scale. Types 3 and 4 correspond to the normal poop form. Types 1 and 2 show that the person has symptoms of constipation. Tip 5,6,7 corresponds to (in order) lack of fiber, mild diarrhea and severe diarrhea.",

Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The least square (LS) mean of the change in weekly number of UI episodes at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.,"Percentage of Subjects With No Episodes of UI at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The number of subjects with no UI episodes at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was recorded. Percentage of subjects with no episodes of UI (≥100% Improvement) was calculated as: Total number of subjects with no weekly number of UI episodes at Week 6 / Total number of subjects with any number of UI events at Week 6.; Percentage of Subjects With a UI Response at Improvement Levels ≥30%, ≥50%, and ≥75% at Week 6 of the DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The percentage of subjects showing an improvement of ≥30%, ≥50% and ≥75% was calculated as: Total number of subjects with UI response level \>=30% or \>=50% or \>=75% improvement at Week 6 / Total number of subjects with any UI response at Week 6.; Median Time Between Treatments [Day of first treatment (baseline) to day of retreatment, up to 2 years] — Duration of effect for time between treatments was calculated by: (the date of the first retreatment visit - date of first treatment administration in the DBPC cycle). The median number of days between treatments was determined and subjects with no retreatment were censored at the last visit.; Mean Change From Baseline in Volume Per Void at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — The volume per void was measured during one 24-hour period of the 7-day bladder diary.
