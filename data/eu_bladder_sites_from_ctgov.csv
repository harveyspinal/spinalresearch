The PGI-I is a 1-item questionnaire designed to assess the patient's impression of change with values ranging from 1 to 7; higher scores mean a worse outcome. Patient is required to ""Check the one number that best describes how you feel now"" by entering his answer on a 7-point scale scored as: (1) ""very much better,"" (2) ""much better,"" (3) ""a little better,"" (4) ""no change,"" (5) ""a little worse,"" (6) ""much worse,"" or (7) ""very much worse."" For this study, investigators will evaluated as primary outcome measure ""the percentage of patient gave a response to PGI-I equal to or less than 2"".","Qualiveen-Short Form (SF) questionnaire [at the end of screening period named Visit 0, and at Visit 2 (weeks 12-16 from Visit 1, that is the management start-up visit)] — In participants with recorded LUTS, it will be measured the patient reported urinary-related quality of life by means of the Qualiveen-Short Form (SF) questionnaire. It's a specific health related quality of life (HRQOL) with questionnaire for urinary disorders in patients with neurological conditions, such as Multiple Sclerosis.

The Qualiveen-SF is an 8-items questionnaire. Response options are framed as 5-point Likert-type scales with 0 indicating no impact of urinary problems on HRQOL and 4 indicating a high adverse impact of urinary difficulty on HRQOL. Qualiveen domain scores are calculated as an average of the scores on items in that domain and, thus, the range is 0 to 4 with an overall score representing the mean of the 4 domains, which also ranges from 0 to 4. Higher scores mean worse outcome.

For this study investigators will evaluated whether three-months (max 4 months) of urinary disorder stable management may change HRQOL in terms of Qualiveen-SF scores.; Post-void residual volume (PVR) assessment [at visit 0 and Visit 2 (weeks 12-16 from Visit 1, that is the management start-up visit)] — The post-void residual volume (PVR) measured in ml is the urine volume remaining in bladder after a physiological micturition. It will be measured by ultrasound scans and calculated by the radiologist subtracting post-void bladder volume from pre-void bladder volume.

For this study, the investigators will evaluate whether three months (max 4 months) of urinary disorder stable management may change the amount of PVR.

Lower volume values mean better outcome.; Micturitions' frequency and episodes of urgency/incontinence at three days frequency/volume chart [at visit 0 and Visit 2 (weeks 12-16 from Visit 1, that is the management start-up visit)] — In participants with recorded LUTS, it will be measured the number of daily micturitions and episodes of urgency or incontinence signed on a three days frequency/volume chart. Frequency/volume chart is a brief diary where patients are asked to record for three days how many times they urinate and the volume of each micturition; they are also asked to record each episode of urinary urgency and incontinence. Higher numbers mean worse outcome.

As secondary outcome, it will be evaluated whether three months (max 4 months) of urinary disorder stable management may change the numbers of micturitions and numbers of urinary urgency and/or incontinence.","Prevalence of LUTS [at Visit 0 (screening visit)] — Considering all participants underwent screening visit, it will be estimated the prevalence of Low Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS); a new diagnostic screening model consisting of the Urinary Bothersome Questionnaire for Multiple Sclerosis (UBQ-MS), the Actionable Bladder Symptoms Screening Tool (ABSST) questionnaire and the PVR volume is used; LUTS is defined by the presence of at least one diagnostic tool with abnormal finding: UBQ-MS score at least 1, ABSST at least 3, PVR at least 100 ml or more than 30% of pre-void assessed volume.; Demographic, Clinical and instrumental characteristics [at visit 0 (screening visit)] — Evaluating the presence of demographic (age, sex, BMI), clinical (disease duration, phenotype, Expanded Disease Status Scale, spinal lesions and their location, therapy, comorbidities) and instrumental factors (urinalysis with urine culture, radiological imaging, number of urinations and urgency-frequency episodes with frequency / volume chart) predictive of the type of urinary disorders reported.; Patient global impression of Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire, Qualiveen-Short Form questionnaire, Post-void residual volume (PVR) amount, Micturitions' frequency and episodes of urgency/incontinence at three days frequency/volume chart [at visit 0 (screening visit) and visit 2 (weeks 12-16 from Visit 1, that is the management start-up visit)] — Finally, by means of a subgroup analysis, the investigators will evaluate whether enrolled participants managed by neurologists or by urologists show any difference in scores of Patient global impression of Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire, Qualiveen-Short Form questionnaire, Post-void residual volume (PVR) assessment, Micturitions' frequency and episodes of urgency/incontinence at three days frequency/volume chart.

It is composed by four questions that evaluate frequency, severity, and impact of incontinence on QoL and another section evaluating usual urinary loss situations. The minimum and maximum values range between 0-21 points. Higher the score, the greater the severity of the symptoms.

The ICIQ-SF has been chosen as the validation questionnaire.; Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score Questionnaire (NBSS) [6 months] — Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score Questionnaire is a 24 item self-reported questionnaire (0-74 points). The questionnaire includes 4 subgroups; incontinence (0-29 points), storage\&voiding (0-22 points) and consequences (0-23 points). Higher the score, the greater the severity of the symptoms.; Qualiveen [6 months] — The Qualiveen is divided in two major sections-Specific Impact of Urinary Problems on Quality of Life (SIUP) and General Quality of Life (GQoL).

The first part, specific for urinary problems, has a total of 30 questions and is divided in four domains: inconvenience, restrictions, fears, and impact on daily life (9, 8, 8, and 5 questions, respectively).

Each answer has five quantified items on a five category ordinal Likert scale with values ranging from 0 (no impact) to 4 (greatest negative impact). The average for each domain is calculated and used to obtain the final SIUP score (average of all domains, range from 0 to 4, 4 being the greatest negative impact).

The second section, GQoL, has nine questions, also with a five-category ordinal Likert scale. It ranges from Very badly to Very well, with values ranging from -2 to +2, respectively.

Final general QoL value is calculated as the average for the nine questions, also ranging from -2 to +2.; Short Form Qualiveen (SF-Qualiveen) [6 months] — The SF-Qualiveen is a validated short version of the Qualiveen questionnaire and evaluates urinary-specific quality of life. The SF-Qualiveen consists of eight questions and reports on four domains of two questions each: bother with limitations, fears, feelings, and frequency of limitations. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert like scale, where a score of 0 indicates ""no impact"" and 4 ""high impact."" The SF-Qualiveen total score is calculated as the mean of the eight responses and the domain scores are calculated as the mean score of the responses per domain.; The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) [6 months] — The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is one of the most widely used for assessing QOL in patients with urinary incontinence (UI).The KHQ consists of two parts and 32 items. The first part (21 items) contains two single-item questions that address General Health Perception and Incontinence Impact and the following seven multi-item domains: Role, Physical, and Social Limitations, Limitations in Personal Relationship, Emotional Problems, Sleep and Energy Disturbances associated with UI, and Severity Measures for UI. The second part has an 11-item Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) that assesses the presence and severity of urinary symptoms. While the entire SSS is scored from 0 (best) to 30 (worst), the minimum possible score is 0 (best health) and the maximum possible score is 100 (worst health) for all other KHQ domains.",,

The SF-Qualiveen questionnaire is a specific health related QoL questionnaire validated for urinary disorders in subjects with neurological conditions containing 8 items looking at four scales: limitations (2 items); constraints (2 items); fears (2 items) and feelings (2 items). The 8 items each having a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0=""Not at all"" to 4=""Extremely"" for the first 6 items, from 0=""Never"" to 4=""Always"" for item 7 and from 0=""Always"" to 4=""Never"" for item 8. The score per scale has been calculated as the mean of the two items. In case of one missing item among the 2 items for a given scale, the score has not been calculated.

Total score has been calculated as the mean of all the items completed among the 8 items.

Lower scores indicate a better QoL (i.e. no limitations, fears, constraints, or negative feelings) and higher scores indicate poorer QoL.; Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score: Before Treatment Injection [Baseline] — Pain assessment using the VAS.

The Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust - Pinderfields Hospital,Wakefield,United Kingdom,Urinary Incontinence; Overactive Bladder,"A Phase III, Multicentre, Randomised, Double Blind, Parallel Group, Placebo Controlled Study To Assess The Efficacy And Safety Of One Or More Intradetrusor Treatments Of 600 Or 800 Units Of Dysport® For The Treatment Of Urinary Incontinence In Subjects With Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity Due To Spinal Cord Injury Or Multiple Sclerosis",NCT02660359,,STUDY_DIRECTOR: Ipsen Medical Director (Ipsen),,,,Mean Change From Baseline in Weekly Number of UI Episodes at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The least square (LS) mean of the change in weekly number of UI episodes at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.,"Percentage of Subjects With No Episodes of UI at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The number of subjects with no UI episodes at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was recorded. Percentage of subjects with no episodes of UI (≥100% Improvement) was calculated as: Total number of subjects with no weekly number of UI episodes at Week 6 / Total number of subjects with any number of UI events at Week 6.; Percentage of Subjects With a UI Response at Improvement Levels ≥30%, ≥50%, and ≥75% at Week 6 of the DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The percentage of subjects showing an improvement of ≥30%, ≥50% and ≥75% was calculated as: Total number of subjects with UI response level \>=30% or \>=50% or \>=75% improvement at Week 6 / Total number of subjects with any UI response at Week 6.; Median Time Between Treatments [Day of first treatment (baseline) to day of retreatment, up to 2 years] — Duration of effect for time between treatments was calculated by: (the date of the first retreatment visit - date of first treatment administration in the DBPC cycle). The median number of days between treatments was determined and subjects with no retreatment were censored at the last visit.; Mean Change From Baseline in Volume Per Void at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — The volume per void was measured during one 24-hour period of the 7-day bladder diary. The LS mean of the change in volume per void at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using a MMRM analysis.; Mean Change From Baseline in Maximum Cystometric Capacity (MCC) at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — Subjects included in the urodynamic subset (84.9% of randomised subjects) had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (Screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the MCC. The LS mean of the change in MCC at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).; Mean Change From Baseline in Maximum Detrusor Pressure (MDP) During Storage at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — Subjects included in the urodynamic subset (84.9% of randomised subjects) had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (Screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the MDP. The LS mean of the change in MDP at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an ANCOVA.; Mean Change From Baseline in Volume at First Involuntary Detrusor Contraction (Vol@1stIDC) at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — Subjects included in the urodynamic subset (84.9% of randomised subjects) had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (Screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the Vol@1stIDC which is the instilled volume when first IDC commences. Subjects who did not exhibit a post-treatment IDC at Week 6 had Vol@1stIDC imputed using the recorded corrected MCC volume at Week 6. The LS mean of the change in Vol@1stIDC at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an ANCOVA.; Percentage of Subjects With No Involuntary Detrusor Contraction (IDCs) During Storage at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle [Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle] — Subjects included in the urodynamic subset (84.9% of randomised subjects) had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (Screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the occurrence of IDCs.
